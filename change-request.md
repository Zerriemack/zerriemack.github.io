# Project Change Request

## Proposed Change
Add an embedded Google Map on the website that displays Fort Worth, Texas. The map will appear on the About page or the homepage, with a short label so visitors understand the location.

## Reasons for the Change
A stakeholder may want this feature because it adds a personal detail and makes the site feel more complete. It also gives visitors a quick way to understand where I am from without reading a long section of text. Since the site represents me professionally, the map adds context and supports credibility.

## How This Change Will Add Value
This change improves user experience by adding a clear visual element. A map is easy to understand at a glance and can make the About section more engaging. It also supports the goal of building a professional web presence by adding a simple feature that looks modern and intentional.

## How This Change Will Affect the Constraints

### Time
Low impact. Writing the change, choosing placement, and adding the embed code would take a short amount of time. Testing would be limited to making sure the map loads and looks clean on desktop and mobile.

### Quality
Moderate impact. The feature should match the site’s layout and styling so it does not feel out of place. The embed should load reliably and not distract from the rest of the page. If it breaks the layout or loads slowly, it would reduce the overall polish.

### Budget
No direct cost. Google Maps embeds are typically free for basic use. The only budget impact would be time spent implementing and reviewing the change.
