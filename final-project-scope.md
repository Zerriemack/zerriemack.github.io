# Project Scope Statement

## Project Title
Zerrie Mack Professional Project Hub Site

## Project Manager
Zerrie Mack

## Project Purpose and Justification
This project creates a single, professional hub website that organizes and presents my work in one place. The site will give visitors a clear path to my projects, curated sources, course work, and contact information without needing to search across multiple repos or links. The hub supports professional presentation, makes my work easier to review, and reduces confusion for instructors, recruiters, and other visitors.

## Project Objectives
1. Publish a live hub site on GitHub Pages that loads correctly on mobile and desktop.
2. Include a Projects page that links to all major projects with short descriptions and working links.
3. Include a Sources page that links to Milly Map Sources and summarizes what it contains.
4. Include a Notes page that links to CMPA Notes and organizes access by course or topic.
5. Include a Contact section that makes it easy to reach me or view my resume.
6. Ensure every navigation link works and there are no broken links on the live site.

## Scope Description
The project will update and expand my existing GitHub Pages site into a clean, consistent hub. The hub will include a homepage and dedicated pages for projects, sources, and notes, along with a contact or resume area. Each page will follow a consistent layout and styling. The focus is clarity, organization, and professional presentation.

## Out of Scope
1. No backend database work for this hub site.
2. No user accounts, logins, or permissions.
3. No paid hosting.
4. No complex search engine or server side features.
5. No requirement to rebuild the full content of external sites inside the hub. The hub will link out to them.
6. No requirement to redesign or refactor Milly Map Sources, Milly Maker Tracker, or CMPA Notes as part of this hub project.

## Assumptions
1. GitHub Pages will remain available for hosting.
2. The live sites and external profile links will remain accessible through their current URLs:
   - <https://zerriemack.github.io/milly-map-sources/>
   - <https://millymakertracker.com/>
   - <https://zerriemack.github.io/CMPA-Notes/>
   - <https://www.teamworkonline.com/business_cards/06d554866f6521c2>
3. I will have access to the repositories and files needed to update the hub.
4. I can gather short descriptions for each project without needing additional research.

## Constraints
1. The project must be completed within the course timeline and submitted by the due date.
2. The site will be built using HTML and CSS, with light JavaScript only if needed for simple interactions.
3. The hub must stay aligned with the approved scope statement.
4. Time is limited due to other course requirements and personal responsibilities.

## Key Stakeholders
1. Instructor, who will evaluate completion, clarity, and alignment with the assignment requirements.
2. Student project manager, who is responsible for planning, building, and submitting on time.
3. Visitors, who need a clear, professional view of my work and quick access to projects and materials.

## High Level Requirements
1. The site must have consistent navigation across all pages.
2. The homepage must include a clear introduction and pathways to Projects, Sources, Notes, and Contact.
3. The Projects page must include a project card for each locked project in this scope statement with a title, short description, and a working link.
4. The Projects page must include working links to:
   - <https://zerriemack.github.io/milly-map-sources/>
   - <https://millymakertracker.com/>
   - <https://zerriemack.github.io/CMPA-Notes/>
   - <https://zerriemack.github.io/>
   - <https://www.teamworkonline.com/business_cards/06d554866f6521c2>
5. The Sources page must include a working link to <https://zerriemack.github.io/milly-map-sources/> and include a short summary of major categories or sections.
6. The Notes page must include a working link to <https://zerriemack.github.io/CMPA-Notes/> and clearly describe how the notes are organized.
7. The site must be readable on mobile and desktop and remain usable on smaller screens.
8. The site must avoid broken links, including internal navigation and external destinations.
9. The design must be consistent across pages, including spacing, typography, and layout.
10. The site must include a Contact area or a clear method for a visitor to reach me professionally.

## Major Milestones
1. Scope statement completed and submitted: February 14, 2026
2. Information architecture finalized and pages outlined: February 15, 2026
3. Projects list finalized and descriptions drafted: February 16, 2026
4. Pages built and styled consistently: February 18, 2026
5. Link check and mobile review completed: February 19, 2026
6. Final submission completed: February 20, 2026

## Estimated Effort and Schedule
Work will be completed in short sessions focused on one page at a time. I will start by locking the navigation structure, then build the Projects page because it drives most of the hub value. After that, I will finalize the Sources and Notes pages. The final stage will be link checking, mobile review, and small styling fixes.

## Risks and Mitigation
1. Risk: Broken external links. Mitigation: verify each link on the live site and update any changed URLs in the Projects page and README.
2. Risk: Scope creep from adding too many pages or features. Mitigation: keep the hub focused on the core pages and use external links for deeper content.
3. Risk: Inconsistent design across pages. Mitigation: use one shared layout pattern and reuse the same CSS across the site.
4. Risk: Running out of time. Mitigation: publish a complete version early, then iterate with small improvements.
5. Risk: Content feels incomplete. Mitigation: prioritize clear project descriptions and working links over adding extra features.

## Change Control
Any changes after scope approval will be handled using a written change request that explains the requested change, the reason for the change, how it adds value, and how it affects time, quality, and budget.
